      <h3><a href="https://github.com/aurangzaib-danial/qa-app">Q & A app</a></h3>
      <p>This is a Q & A app similar to Stack Overflow. I built this web app with Ruby on Rails and its new front-end framework called Hotwire. I'm particularly proud of this project as I have tried to use all the cool technologies and techniques that I have learnt so far like real-time notifications, efficient database queries, robust authorization etc.</p>

      <p>This is an e-books shopping app that I made to practice my NextJS, React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS skills. Entire front-end is handled by NextJS while api services are provided by a Ruby on Rails server.</p>
